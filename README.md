## The Problem being solved

This project aims to resolve some frustrations I got tired of:
1. Refreshing the loan out page to see if there were new loans for me to lend out the minimum amount of 200 pesos (ie. executing a diversification strategy).
2. Missing opportunities when I wasn't able to refresh the loan out page due to not being a robot.
3. Manually exporting my data from the yotepresto Web UI.
4. Overcoming limitations in the 'Autoinvest' feature which was recently released

*Auto pretty much what this tool does.

However, there are limitations with 'Autoinvest', which you can read on their [site](yotepresto.com).


## Roadmap

1. Improve the CLI (execute different types of tasks based on CLI flags) -- replacing the current commented out code
2. Add configuration/re-configuration of user and lending settings
3. Schedule loan out page refreshes via crontabs
4. Address code quality issues
5. Localize README.md into Spanish

## A note to the team at yotepresto.com

- Your team has built a really great marketplace that I love using!
- Please don't interpret this tool as a means or a statement that your work isn't valued!
- The work your team does is super valuable as it democratises the way people borrow money and loan money to earn interest.
- It also circumvents incumbents in the market who aren't providing competitive interest rates.

If any of your team members ever visit Melbourne, Australia, please reach out to me and I'll shout you a cold one (ie. cerveza)!
